This repository contains a collection of Java programs designed to solve classic data structure problems. Each file demonstrates a specific algorithm or matrix manipulation technique, making this a valuable resource for students, educators, and developers looking to strengthen their understanding of data structures in Java.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| File Name                     | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `Problem1.java`              | Solves a foundational matrix-based problem, typically involving traversal or transformation. |
| `Problem2.java`              | A follow-up to Problem1, likely introducing a variation or optimization. |
| `Diagonal_Sum.java`          | Calculates the sum of the diagonals in a 2D matrix. Useful for understanding matrix indexing. |
| `RotateAnticlockwise.java`   | Rotates a matrix 90 degrees anticlockwise. Demonstrates in-place rotation logic. |
| `RotateAnticlockwise1.java`  | An alternate approach to matrix rotation, possibly using auxiliary space. |
| `Spiral_Order.java`          | Traverses a matrix in spiral order. Great for mastering boundary control and loop logic. |
| `Transpose_Matrix.java`      | Computes the transpose of a matrix. A fundamental operation in linear algebra. |
| `Wave_Torem_Traversal.java`  | Implements wave traversal of a matrix, moving in a zigzag pattern across rows or columns. |
| `Output Assignment 1 Problem 1.png` | Visual output or screenshot related to Problem1, useful for verification or presentation. |
